# CUBE-ARDUINO:

This repository contains Arduino-based code for implementing a LoRa (Long Range) communication system, encompassing both transmitter and receiver functionalities. The project is designed to facilitate wireless data transmission over extended distances using LoRa technology.

---

## 📖 Overview

LoRa is a wireless communication technology known for its long-range and low-power characteristics, making it ideal for IoT applications. This project provides Arduino sketches for both transmitting and receiving data using LoRa modules. It serves as a foundational framework for developing more complex LoRa-based communication systems.

---

## ✨ Features

- Arduino-compatible code for LoRa transmission and reception.
- Modular design separating transmitter and receiver functionalities.
- Configurable parameters for frequency, bandwidth, and spreading factor.
- Basic error handling and data validation mechanisms.

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

To replicate or build upon this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

- Two Arduino boards (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
- Two LoRa modules (e.g., SX1278, RFM95)
- Connecting wires and breadboards or PCBs for prototyping
- Power supply for the Arduino boards

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Arduino IDE
- LoRa library

---

## 🚀️ Installation Instructions

Getting Started

- Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/storres20/cube-arduino.git
```

- Install the LoRa Library:

  Open the Arduino IDE, navigate to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...`, and search for "LoRa". Install the library by Sandeep Mistry or any other compatible library for your hardware.

- Connect the Hardware:

  Wire the LoRa modules to the Arduino boards according to your module's specifications. Typically, you'll connect:

  - MOSI
  - MISO
  - SCK
  - NSS (CS)
  - DIO0
  - GND
  - 3.3V (or 5V, depending on the module)

- Upload the Code:

  - For the transmitter, open the transmitter sketch from the LORA folder and upload it to one Arduino board.
  - For the receiver, open the receiver sketch from the LORA folder and upload it to the second Arduino board.

---

## 🛠 Usage

- Transmitter:

  The transmitter Arduino board will send predefined messages at set intervals. You can modify the message content and transmission frequency within the transmitter sketch.

- Receiver:

  The receiver Arduino board will listen for incoming messages and display them via the Serial Monitor. Ensure the Serial Monitor is set to the correct baud rate as specified in the receiver sketch.
